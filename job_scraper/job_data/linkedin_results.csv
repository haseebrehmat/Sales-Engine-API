This is a full service engineering role though so they will participate in scrums for tasking, program code, and test and troubleshoot their own code.

There will be a good amount of time trying to figure out how to get their code integrated into the millions of lines of existing code from the current baselines. https://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do/aerospace-defense/naval-systems.html Best vs Average:
Best candidate is someone who is willing to spend several weeks in the Test and Integration phase troubleshooting their code until it works in the system.

With this being a legacy product that has been around for several years their are several challenges integrating new code.
This group is the problem solver for the rest of the engineers on the team so they need to love to solve problems.

When an issue arises with another group and they cannot solve it then is gets escalated to this group to solve.

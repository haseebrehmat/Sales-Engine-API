Contributed to open source projects

Experience in Solidity writing performant, memory efficient code

Ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively with the team and internal/external organizations

Proficient ability in code versioning tools such as Git

It'd be to nice to find someone who also has:

Who we are ?
DIMO enables thousands of vehicle owners and operators to collect, use, and monetize the data their vehicles generate. We're building an open developer platform to transform the massive vehicle data and connected car market, and bootstrapping the supply and demand side with the $DIMO token.

Our core team is made up of experienced IoT, automotive, mobility, and web3 engineers, designeers, and operators, and we are committed to building a distributed organization.
Our values
We are a global, remote-friendly company. For those local to Detroit or New York, we have in-person office space for you to pull up a chair and work IRL. Team members can expect quarterly in-person events once individuals feel comfortable traveling again.

We are fueled by an immense intellectual curiosity of what technology can do and the impact it can have. We succeed as a team when we embrace individual differences.

",Art+Logic,Remote,"Art+Logic is looking for a Senior Full Stack .NET Developer to work with us on interesting custom software projects. We’ve been an all-remote company since day one—more than thirty years ago—and we’re still going strong.
Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.
The skills and needs for each project we tackle can vary widely; this goes beyond just the languages and technologies we use, and extends to the industries and problem domains we work in. We love working with developers who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow in your strength and your versatility at Art+Logic and we want to help you do so.
We work remotely all over North America. We expect you to be able to work with minimal supervision and comfortably with small teams of 3-8 people. You won’t have someone looking over your shoulder, so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable.
We value work/life balance, and our projects keep meetings to a minimum to ensure everyone has the flexibility to work during the times that work best for them. We are looking for contract developers able to commit between 30 and 40 hours a week most weeks, and we never expect our developers to work more than 40 hours in a given week.
Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we ourselves would like to be treated.

We are ONLY looking for people in the North American continent. (This includes the United State, Canada, and Mexico.)
It’s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren’t always indicators of what someone can do.

Prefer lead and senior app dev roles to have significant experience building mobile apps in ReactNative. Base app dev role we can be flexible with level of experience
Candidates will need to have experience with building a ReactNative application which can leverage platform specific APIs/SDKs. As such they should have experience working with both platforms (iOS & Android). One call out, candidates do NOT need experience building native iOS/android apps. They do need to have experience building a cross-platform application using ReactNative
100% new build for MVP application features. As features are deployed will need candidates to perform some on-call/support functionality. Majority of the day/week will be spent on new feature development and enhancements
At this time, this project will be focused on new development. As features are deployed to market some support hours will be required
Forming new team
This app will be written in the React Native language. This role might have the ability to write/integrate with internal APIs, but for now my need is for React Native application developers.
There is a subtle difference between React Native (what I’m looking for) and React JS (used for website development).

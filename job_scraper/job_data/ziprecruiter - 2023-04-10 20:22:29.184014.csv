By deploying technology and providing operational efficiencies, PURE enhances resident and investor experiences.

They are looking for a Principal Backend Software Engineer for a player-coach role focused on shipping a new, high-scale platform for property managers.

Position Summary

We genuinely have a fantastic situation here at PURE. This role is part of a distributed team of engineers, designers and product managers who are building a new platform for property managers in collaboration with our users, who are deeply insightful and incredible to work with. Our company mission is crystal clear. Our technology mandate is well-formulated, properly-funded, and 100% supported by our leadership.

In this role, you will:
Lead the backend practice. This means you will be our main subject-matter expert on all things backend - API development, 3rd party integrations, service architecture, workflow and business logic implementation, logical data architecture, etc. This will require you to be a solid and hands-on architectural thinker who loves to implement what you have come up with. You care a lot about whether a potential solution actually works in practice and aren’t afraid to get your hands dirty.
Contribute in a player-coach role, mentoring engineers (both internal and contract) on backend topics and generally serving as the primary subject-matter-expert in this area. This role does not have any direct reports (our team is small), but it is a very important practice lead within the organization and there is a strong leadership component.
Own our service architecture and the coherence of our platform backend. We are building a multi-domain platform with a lot of 3p integrations and complex data flows operating at scale. We need someone who has done this before.
Match technology to user needs - Taking the time to understand our business objectives, you will work with the team to ensure that our technological decisions and execution enable the use cases and value proposition we need to deliver to our users.
Exemplify development best practices - You will be a model to the rest of the team about how to deliver features with high quality and solid architectural thinking.
Communicate tech in a way that makes it seem simple. You can explain technology to non-engineers and work with product and business leaders to make sure the translation between the business need and what gets built is smooth and accurate.


Requirements
Tech Stack:
Google Cloud
VueJs
NodeJs
Typescript
GraphQL/Apollo
Postgres
CI/CD delivery model
Kubernetes
Google Cloud Serverless

Your Profile:
10 years of experience in software development, or 8 years with an advanced degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, or Software Engineering.
Significant experience with data platforms, pipelines, and serverless functions. We are building a data-intensive product with a lot of complex workflows - you should have done this before.
Significant experience with 3rd party API integrations. Similarly, we use a lot of 3p integrations. We need someone who really understands how to do this well at scale.
Significant experience with complex business logic and workflows. Our workflows drive critical cross-domain automation. You should have broken something like this at least once and understand how not to do it again.
Significant experience with modern and secure cloud development practices. You will be a key expert and source of technical judgment on our team. You should have the experience to back that up.

Preferred qualifications:
You are an empathetic leader with a demonstrated ability to motivate teammates by creating a shared sense of purpose, community and collaboration.
You are a great communicator with the ability to create a compelling argument for ideas, and work cross-functionally in a collaborative manner.
You like start-up/scale-up environments and new products. We are a pretty organized start-up, but we’re still a start-up building a new platform - that entails a certain amount of ambiguity and change.
You love data platforms and enterprise-grade products. The scale, the integrations, all the moving parts. It’s the kind of challenge you consistently seek out.

Benefits
These are critical to everything we do at PURE:
User empathy - Our users define our business. We listen to them, understand their needs, and act on that understanding.
Freedom and responsibility - We’re obsessed with results. You get to choose how to get there.

Project Overview:
Thacker Pass is the largest known lithium resource in the United States and the next large-scale lithium mine. The project has all permits required to commence construction, which is expected to start in 2023. Engineering design and procurement of long-lead equipment is underway, with early works being coordinated.
 This project falls under the Lithium Americas umbrella of Lithium Nevada Corporation (LNC). Project site is located ~3 hours northeast of Reno at the southern end of the McDermitt Caldera in Humboldt County, NV, and ~25 miles from the Nevada-Oregon border (or ~1 hour northwest of Winnemucca, NV). 
The Project will be developed as an open-pit mining operation using conventional, continuous mining equipment. Given the soft, clay nature of the deposit, minimal blasting and crushing is anticipated. The ore will then be processed in a leaching circuit using sulfuric acid to liberate the lithium from the claystone. Following the leaching process, the lithium bearing solution will be purified using crystallizers and reagents to produce battery-quality Li2CO3.
 The Thacker Pass site has a flat and expansive terrain which allows for a very compact footprint and for future potential expansions.

The Project Controls Engineer will be assigned to the project full-time, taking direction from the Lead Planner/Scheduler. The position will support our planning and scheduling efforts, as well as support our Level 3 EPCM schedule development.

The incumbent performs professional duties to achieve an integrated system of sound land use and conservation treatment in harmony with the capability and needs of the land and landowner.
Qualifications: Applicants must meet all qualifications and eligibility requirements by the closing date of the announcement including time-in-grade restrictions, specialized experience and/or education, as defined below.

Time in grade: (e.g. one year at the GS-09 grade level for consideration for the GS-11 grade level). Applicants must have completed at least 52 weeks at the next lower grade, or have held the same grade or higher grade level as the one advertised in order to be considered for this position.

Basic Education Requirement: Degree: soil conservation or related agricultural or natural resource discipline such as agronomy, soil science, forestry, agricultural education, or agricultural engineering. The study must have included 30 semester hours in a natural resource or agricultural field, including at least 12 semester hours in a combination of soils and crops or plant science. Of the 12 semester hours, a minimum of 3 semester hours must have been in soils and 3 semester hours in crops or plant science;OR

Combination of education and experience: at least 30 semester hours in one or more of the disciplines as shown in 1 above, including at least 12 semester hours in a combination of soils and crops or plant science, plus appropriate experience or additional education. Of the 12 semester hours, a minimum of 3 semester hours must have been in soils and 3 semester hours in crops or plant science.
In addition to meeting one of the Basic Requirements listed above, applicants must meet the following Minimum Qualification Requirement in order to be considered: Specialized Experience Requirement for GS-11: To qualify for the GS-11, you must possess one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-09 level in the Federal service, or comparable experience not gained through federal service. The experience requires the knowledge of the principles and theories of soil and water conservation and related sciences such as biology, agronomy, and forestry, in identifying conservation related problems.Examples include:
Providing technical guidance and assistance to groups and individuals on topics such as soil interpretations, erosion control measures, pest and invasive species control, water quality improvements, livestock management, wildlife habitat, and forest management.
Preparing conservation or resource management plans and providing financial or implementation assistance.
Communicating and sharing general information and explaining issues related to natural resource conservation, problems, and solutions to landowners, residents, and land managers.
OREducation Substitution: 3 years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to a Ph.D. degree or Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree in a soil conservation or related agricultural or natural resource discipline such as agronomy, soil science, forestry, agricultural education, or agricultural engineering.OR

Combination of Education and Experience: College-level education or training that provided knowledge equivalent to that described above, plus appropriate technical experience or additional education.
Evaluation of Education: Education that provided specialized knowledge and skills in soil and water conservation is more valuable than education that imparted broad but general knowledge and skills. Courses in soil fertility, soil chemistry, soil genesis, plant physiology, plant science, and field crops are examples of specialized courses that contribute towards meeting the required 12 semester hours as described above. Courses in the physical sciences or engineering such as geology, civil engineering, and hydrology also meet the soils, crops, or plant science course requirements where such courses included a complete introduction to the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils.
Evaluation of Experience: Experience that included the application of techniques, principles, and methods from a variety of agricultural and natural resource fields is appropriate, given the interdisciplinary character of the soil conservation occupation. For example, experience gained in a specialized field such as soil science, forestry, or agronomy is as fully acceptable as experience directly obtained in soil conservation work.
Specialized Experience Requirement for GS-12: To qualify for the GS-12, you must possess one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-11 level in the Federal service, or comparable experience not gained through federal service. The experience requires the knowledge of the principles and theories of soil and water conservation and related sciences such as biology, agronomy, and forestry, in identifying conservation related problems.

Analyzing workloads, developing and implementing annual work or business plans, and establishing goals within the constraints of funding and staff availability.
Directing technical guidance and assistance to groups and individuals on topics such as soil interpretations, erosion control measures, pest and invasive species control, water quality improvements, livestock management, wildlife habitat, and forest management.

Our core team is made up of experienced IoT, automotive, mobility, and web3 engineers, designeers, and operators, and we are committed to building a distributed organization.
Our values
We are a global, remote-friendly company. For those local to Detroit or New York, we have in-person office space for you to pull up a chair and work IRL. Team members can expect quarterly in-person events once individuals feel comfortable traveling again.

We are fueled by an immense intellectual curiosity of what technology can do and the impact it can have. We succeed as a team when we embrace individual differences.

",Art+Logic,Remote,"Art+Logic is looking for a Senior Full Stack .NET Developer to work with us on interesting custom software projects. We’ve been an all-remote company since day one—more than thirty years ago—and we’re still going strong.
Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.
The skills and needs for each project we tackle can vary widely; this goes beyond just the languages and technologies we use, and extends to the industries and problem domains we work in. We love working with developers who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow in your strength and your versatility at Art+Logic and we want to help you do so.
We work remotely all over North America. We expect you to be able to work with minimal supervision and comfortably with small teams of 3-8 people. You won’t have someone looking over your shoulder, so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable.
We value work/life balance, and our projects keep meetings to a minimum to ensure everyone has the flexibility to work during the times that work best for them. We are looking for contract developers able to commit between 30 and 40 hours a week most weeks, and we never expect our developers to work more than 40 hours in a given week.
Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we ourselves would like to be treated.

We are ONLY looking for people in the North American continent. (This includes the United State, Canada, and Mexico.)
It’s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren’t always indicators of what someone can do.

"Smart Contract Engineer
",Espresso,Remote,"Espresso's mission is to bring Web3 applications like decentralized finance, NFTs, and DAOs to the mainstream by making them cheaper, scalable, and more private for users.

The Espresso Sequencer supports the decentralization of layer-2 (L2) rollups in the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond. It handles the decentralized sequencing and data availability of rollup transactions, functioning as a middleware between underlying layer-1 (L1) platforms and any zk-VM or optimistic VM.

In addition to scalability, Espresso supports applications with greater privacy guarantees than exist in today's smart contract ecosystems. Leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, Espresso has developed the Configurable Asset Privacy (CAP) protocol that allows developers to determine what transactional data remains private and for whom.

Contributors to Espresso comprise a diverse team located around the world. We are passionate about building a better infrastructure for how we transact and interact online. We are builders, designers, researchers, and hackers and have contributed in academia, in open source communities, in policymaking, and beyond. We are backed by over $30mm in funding from leading investors in technology and crypto including Greylock Partners, Electric Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Polychain Capital.

As a Smart Contract Engineer, you will closely collaborate with fellow engineers and product managers to build infrastructure to bring Espresso's privacy and scalability infrastructure to the Ethereum ecosystem. Examples of work include building a cross-chain bridge for moving assets between Ethereum and Espresso, and implementing a Solidity smart contract to validate blocks for a private and auditable transaction system on Ethereum.

Guided by The NIMHD Research Framework, this research will study the effects of intersectional identities on racial/ethnic equity, reduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) bias, and develop a culturally sensitive novel habit-building algorithm for minority Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients using Creative Arts Therapy (CAT: Music, Dance, Arts) for remote activity engagement systems with multilevel data tracking and effective behavior prompts. We will partner with Stanford, Institute on Aging, Koelsch Communities, Generation United, and Heritage On The Marina to develop a groundbreaking smart platform integrating biosensors and a Telehealth Live Video Platform (TLVP). This project aims to gather insights into different domains (Biological, Behavioral, Physical/Built Environment, Sociocultural Environment, Healthcare System) and levels (Individual, Interpersonal, Community, Societal) that influence healthy habits, then analyze the data to adapt D4H to improve patients’ mobility and social connections. D4H’s proprietary personalization will tailor to users’ needs/desires and pair them with compatible buddies to build lasting habits with recorded and live video classes (think YouTube + Zoom + eHarmony for health buddies).
You will work with a multidisciplinary team of experts in health disparity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, biotracking, behavioral sciences, dance therapy, and data/AI science. Research experience is a bonus but not required.
WebRTC Software Engineer Role:
Build a user-friendly interface tailored to varied preferences, mobility, and accessibility needs.
Determine how tracking and adaptive video technology can be used to develop a personalized habit-building platform, integrating cultural awareness.
Design changes or additions to the current telehealth platform, particularly in incorporating body tracking or additional musical feedback elements.
Select platforms, plan features and define the architecture and technology road map.
Adopt an appropriate development methodology. Estimate costs and timelines.
Integrate bio-sensors to telehealth platforms (ReactJS, WebRTC, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Why this study: 34.2 M Americans with DM cost $327 B in 2018. 68% of them will die from cardiovascular disease. CDC reported that DM disproportionately affects minorities. Partnering with Stanford professors Dr. Palaniappan and Dr. Haddad, who have pioneered research on health disparities and exercise/dance intervention for DM patients, this innovation will expand the research field and have a broader impact on minority health. Currently, there is a lack of data on effective lifestyle recommendations for normal-weight diabetics (NWD), accounting for 1 in 5 Type II DM patients. NWD is especially prevalent in Asian populations and the elderly, facing higher mortality rates than obese diabetics. Research shows dance improves DM and reduces cardiovascular deaths by 46%. These interventions, however, are only available in person. There are many exercise programs and live video tools, but they rarely cater to an individual’s mobility and accessibility needs. Hence, there is an unmet need for an easy-to-adopt telehealth platform enticing patients to dance from home.
AI Bias: Integrating AI into clinical practice requires addressing biases. Three types of bias can be identified in healthcare: data-driven, algorithmic, and human. AI algorithms that propagate deeply-rooted societal bias can have catastrophic impacts. Consequently, some patient groups, such as ethnic and gender minorities underrepresented in existing datasets, can be misdiagnosed, further amplifying inequalities. Every step of the algorithm development process can be influenced by bias. It begins when designing the study and collecting data, continues with data entry, cleaning, and algorithm design, and ends with implementing the models and disseminating the results.
Impact and Next Step: This study will establish clear metrics of health equity success; outcomes will be publicized (papers/conferences) to incentivize action and influence policymakers. It will lay the groundwork for a multicenter trial with American Heart Association to integrate more biosensors, voice user interfaces, and culture-sensitive AI to further increase adoption and engagement and reduce health disparities.
